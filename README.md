# learning-basics

A small personal repository for learning basic programming concepts and experiments.

Status
------
This repository currently contains minimal files. Use this README as a starting point to document the project's purpose and how to work with it.

What this repo is for
---------------------
- Notes, examples, and tiny exercises for learning programming fundamentals.
- Short experiments or code snippets demonstrating concepts.

Repository layout
-----------------
At the moment this repository is minimal. Add source code under meaningful folders (for example `python/`, `js/`, `notes/`, etc.) depending on the language or topic.

Getting started
---------------
1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/anupJag/learning-basics.git

2. Create a new folder for the language or topic you want to explore, e.g. `python/` or `js/`.
3. Add small, focused examples and a short README inside each folder explaining the exercises.

Contributing
------------
- Open a pull request with your additions.
- Keep changes small and well-documented. If you add code, include a short explanation and, if relevant, a minimal test or example to run.

Suggested next steps
--------------------
- Add a language-specific folder (e.g., `python/`) with a tiny example and a README.
- Add basic CI (GitHub Actions) to run linting or tests for any code you add.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md if you expect others to contribute.
