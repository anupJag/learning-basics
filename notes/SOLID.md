# SOLID PRINCIPLES
Solid Principles are the foundation of programming. Solid Principle allows code to be reusable, scalable and maintainable.

- S - SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINICPLE
- O - OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE
- L - LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
- I - INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE
- D - DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Think for a moment, a mobile phone has the same USB-Type C port which is accessible by a headphone, a charger, etc. This allows the extend the original functionality keeping the integrity of the UBS controller.

Why does OCP matter?
OCP allows adding new functionality without changing the tested/working code; this reduces regression risk (need to retested the entire application once again)
